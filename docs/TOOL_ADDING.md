# Tool Submission Rules

Thanks for contributing to DevJuice! Please follow these simple rules when submitting a tool through the website:

1.  **Provide accurate information** — Double-check the tool name, URL, and category.
2.  **Ensure the URL works** — Broken or redirect-heavy links will be rejected.
3.  **Check for account requirements** — If the tool needs sign-up or login, make a note of it.
4.  **Mention pricing clearly** — Select the right option: `Free`, `Freemium`, or `Premium`.
5.  **Description is optional** — We'll auto-fetch it from the tool's metadata.

> Submissions that don't follow these rules may be rejected during review.
