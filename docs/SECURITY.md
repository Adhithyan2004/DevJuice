## 📣 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability (like someone being able to bypass admin, access data without permission, or abuse tool submission), please **do not post it publicly**.

Instead, report it privately to:

📧 **Email**: adhibanugopan@gmail.com

### What to include in the email:

- A clear explanation of the issue
- Steps to reproduce it (if possible)
- Why it might be dangerous
- Your GitHub username (if you'd like credit)

## 💬 For Non-Critical Bugs or Suggestions

If your issue is not security-sensitive (like layout bugs, suggestions, or small improvements), please use:

🗨️ [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Adhithyan2004/DevJuice/discussions)  
(It’s public, and others can help too!)

---

## ✅ Supported Version

We maintain security fixes only for the **latest version** of the project. Please ensure you're using the most recent version of the codebase before reporting any issues.
