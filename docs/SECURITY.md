##  Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability (like someone being able to bypass admin, access data without permission, or abuse tool submission), please **do not post it publicly**.

Instead, report it privately to:

### What to include in the email:

- A clear explanation of the issue
- Steps to reproduce it (if possible)
- Why it might be dangerous
- Your GitHub username (if you'd like credit)

##  Supported Version

We maintain security fixes only for the **latest version** of the project. Please ensure you're using the most recent version of the codebase before reporting any issues.

Thanks for helping make Dev Juice better and safer.
