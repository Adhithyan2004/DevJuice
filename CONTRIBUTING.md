##  Code Style & Folder Structure

> We try to keep things consistent, but this is still a growing project! Here's how we structure things right now:

###  Frontend (Next.js)
- We use **TypeScript (`.tsx`)** files for all components
- Pages go inside `app/`, components in `components/`, and API calls in `lib/api.ts`
- Follow a **functional and modular** approach (1 file = 1 purpose)

Please format your code with **Prettier** and **ESLint** if you're making changes.

###  Backend (FastAPI)
- API routes are grouped in files inside the `routers/` folder (`tools.py`, `auth.py`, etc.)
- We use **Pydantic models** for request/response schemas (in `schemas/`)
- DB logic stays in `database.py` and `crud.py` (separated for clarity)

Use `black` for Python formatting and keep endpoints RESTful.
